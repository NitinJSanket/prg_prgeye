## Hardware

### H6 board
- dimension limit 35x35mm
- remove all peripherals 
- Keep CSI ports, USB ports, serial ports
- headers all around or ribbon cables like jevois

## Software

### Neural Network Based Homography Computation
Code can be found in [Software/DeepLearning/HomographyNetUnsup](Software/DeepLearning/HomographyNetUnsup). Follow these instructions for training and testing.

#### Training
- Download MS-COCO dataset from [here](http://cocodataset.org/#home). We'll use the train2014 set for training.
- Prepare text files for training by running the [DataParse.py](Software/DeepLearning/HomographyNetUnsup/DataPrase.py) code. Specify ``--ReadPath`` and ``--WritePath`` as the path to COCO dataset. For eg. ``/home/nitin/Datasets/MSCOCO/train2014``.
- Run the [TrainHomographyNet.py](Software/DeepLearning/HomographyNetUnsup/TrainHomographyNet.py) and specify the following command line flags. You can use execute ``./TrainHomographyNet.py -h`` to obtain the help given below.
  - ``--BasePath``: Path where Images are stored. For this eg. ``/home/nitin/Datasets/MSCOCO/train2014``.
  - ``--DivTrain``: Factor to reduce Train data by per epoch. Used only for debugging.
  - ``--MiniBatchSize``: Size of the MiniBatch to use.
  - ``--LoadCheckPoint``: Resume Training by loading latest model from CheckPointPath.
  - ``--RemoveLogs``: Depracated. DO NOT USE.
  - ``--LossFuncName``: Choice of Loss functions, choose from PhotoL1, PhotoChab, PhotoRobust. Used only for Unsupervised training.
  - ``--NetworkType``: Choice of Network type, choose from Small, Large. Use Large for training on Images. Small network doesn't have enough capacity to learn anything on images but works on event frames.
  - ``--CheckPointPath``: Path to save checkpoints.
  - ``--LogsPath``: Path to save TensorBoard Logs.
  - ``--GPUDevice``: Use specific GPU Number when you have multiple GPUs. Use -1 for running on CPU.
  - ``--LR``: Learning Rate.
  - ``TrainingType``: S for Supervised and US for unsupervised. Uses Loss function from ``--LossFuncName`` when training in US mode. Uses L2 loss in S mode.
- Recommended to train about 50-100 Epochs at Batch Size of 32-256.

#### Testing
- Not implemented yet!
