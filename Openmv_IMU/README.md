## Caveats about OpenMv cam 
- If any file/data needs to be saved on the OpenMv cam module save it in the SD card and not the internal memory of the module
- When the OpenMv cam module is plugged into the system, file explorer should automatically open. If this doesn't happen then there's something wrong and you should refer to [OpenMv documentation](http://docs.openmv.io/index.html). 

## Pin connections
The pin connections can be clearly seen in the images below.
